There are a couple of ways to go about publishing your project, but the simplest is the following:

Make sure that the main HTML file of your project is called index.html. If it is not, you need to rename it.
Go to your GitHub repo on the web and click the Settings button.
Click on Pages on the left side bar.
Change the Source from none to main branch and click Save.
It may take a few minutes (the GitHub website says up to 10), but your project should be accessible over the web from your-github-username.github.io/your-github-repo-name (obviously substituting your own details in the link).
